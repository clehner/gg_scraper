Google Group Scrapper
=====================

   :alt: Build Status

A small script as a replacement of `the old PHP script`_ for downloading messages stored in the black hole of the Google Groups.

.. _`the old PHP script`:
    http://saturnboy.com/2010/03/scraping-google-groups/

How to use it?
--------------

This script requires ``formail(1)`` from ``procmail`` package. Any
version is OK, so please install it from your distributionâ€™s
repositories. Then run:

::

    pip install beautifulsoup4 PyYAML
    python gg_scraper.py 'https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/<group_name>'

Background
----------

I would never start without an inspiration from the comment_ on my previous post on the theme of locked down nature of Google Groups.

Current bugs are filled at my bugzilla_ and new ones can be reported via
email (one of many of my addresses are available on my `Github page`_)

Of course pull requests are more than welcome in the same places as
well. Currently all development is done with Python 3.3, but tests are
run on Travis-CI_ for 2.6, 2.7, pypy, and 3.2 as well.
