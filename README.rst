A small script as a replacement of `the old PHP script`_ for downloading messages stored in the black hole of the Google Groups.

I would never start without an inspiration from the comment_ on my previous post on the theme of locked down nature of Google Groups.

Current bugs are filled at my bugzilla_ and new ones can be reported via
email (one of many of my addresses are available on my `Github page`_ )

Of course pull requests are more than welcome in the same places as
well.  Currently all development is done with Python 3.3, but tests are
run on Travis-CI for 2.6, 2.7, and pypy as well.
